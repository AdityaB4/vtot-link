# vtot-link
> A (WIP) project to solve my gripes with VirusTotal's CLI and API

## Setup
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/getting-started)
to get access to the public VirusTotal API

<!-- TODO: Make this work -->
If you are on a mac, simply use brew to install the vtot-link:
```
brew install vtot-link (does not work right now)
```
